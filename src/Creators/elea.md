Eléa is a student in the Dual BA between Columbia University and Sciences Po (’25) majoring in Economics and Political Science. Her main areas of interest include Finance, Development Economics, and 19th-century Political History. Born and raised in Annecy, France, she served as an executive member of the Sciences Po Arts Council for two years prior to her arrival in New York.
When she is not hiding in one of Columbia’s libraries working on an Economics problem set, you will find her exploring the city or playing music. She has performed with several choirs, including the Columbia-Barnard Chorus, and even sang with a symphonic orchestra at the conservatory of her hometown. After gaining experience as a Business Analyst intern at FTI Delta during her time at Columbia, Eléa aims to leverage her analytical skills and interest in the intersection of finance and technology to pursue a career in the consulting industry.
