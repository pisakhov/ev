I am a student at Barnard College of Columbia University, majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My experience as an investment analyst intern has equipped me with financial expertise. At the same time, my roles as a business support assistant and warehouse manager have honed my organization and leadership skills.

I am passionate about making a social impact, demonstrated through my leadership roles in nonprofits and startups. I am eager to leverage my diverse experiences to excel in the world of consulting, tech, and investment banking.
